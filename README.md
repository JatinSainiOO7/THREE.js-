## Introduction to Three.js

### What is Three.js?

Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. It uses WebGL under the hood, which is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics without the need for plug-ins. Three.js simplifies the process of writing complex 3D scenes with its easy-to-use API.

### Why Use Three.js?

Three.js is popular among developers for several reasons:
- **Ease of Use:** It abstracts the complexities of WebGL, making it easier to create 3D content.
- **Rich Feature Set:** Includes support for lights, shadows, materials, geometries, and much more.
- **Community and Documentation:** A large, active community and extensive documentation help developers troubleshoot issues and learn best practices.
