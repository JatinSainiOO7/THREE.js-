# Three.js Project

![Three.js Logo](https://threejs.org//examples/textures/crate.gif)

## Introduction

This project is a demonstration of Three.js, a lightweight, 3D library with a default WebGL renderer. It enables the creation of 3D content in a browser. This README serves as a guide to set up the project, understand its structure, and explore its features.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed before proceeding:

- **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is installed with Node.js. Check its presence by running `npm -v` in your terminal.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/threejs-project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: 
    ```bash
    cd threejs-project
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: 
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the Development Server**: 
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. **Access the Application**: 
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code of the project.
    - **`index.js`**: The main JavaScript file where the Three.js scene is created and configured.
    - **`assets/`**: Directory for storing 3D models, textures, and other assets used in the project.
    - **`components/`**: Contains reusable components or utilities for building the 3D scene.
    - **`scenes/`**: Different scenes or examples showcasing various features of Three.js.
- **`public/`**: Contains static assets and the HTML file where the Three.js canvas is rendered.

## Features

This project demonstrates various features of Three.js, including:

- **Rendering**: Create and render 3D scenes using WebGL.
- **Geometry**: Generate 3D objects such as cubes, spheres, and custom shapes.
- **Materials**: Apply materials like colors, textures, and shaders to objects.
- **Lighting**: Add different types of lights (ambient, directional, point, etc.) to the scene.
- **Cameras**: Implement different camera types (PerspectiveCamera, OrthographicCamera) for viewing the scene.
- **Controls**: Enable user interaction with the scene through controls like OrbitControls, TrackballControls, etc.
- **Animations**: Animate objects using keyframe animation or through code.
- **Loading Models**: Import 3D models from external files (OBJ, FBX, glTF) and integrate them into the scene.
